# project-4-oop-game-show-app

This is the 4th project for the Treehouse FSJS Techdegree
The HTML and CSS were provide.  I am adding the JS for functionality.

After clicking the Start Game button, the start screen disappears revealing
a keyboard and blank phrase to be guessed.  Right now, the keyboard on screen
is the only way to interact, but I will be adding regular keyboard support as well.
